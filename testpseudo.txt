test pseudocode:

get a user's anime info with userParser (input: username)
take the first entry in the resulting array:
	var a = results[0][0] //animeid
	var b = results[0][1] //animetitle
		replace any " " in b with "_"
	var c = "http://http://myanimelist.net/anime/" + a + "/" + b
call the genreParser using c as input argument
for each entry in the resulting array:
	change the entry by passing it through genreConverter
combine all the results into a single string
call searchParser, using "" as the first argument, and the string from the previous line as the second argument
the results from this will be recommended anime
